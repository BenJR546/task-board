# Task Board

## Description
Task Board is a web application that allows users to create task cards and move them between status columns. It's designed for anyone who wants to break down a project into manageable tasks.

## Demo
[Watch the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx7SrcvxBCo) to see the Task Board app's functionality.
## Features
- Create task cards with a description and due date.
- Move task cards between "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns using simple drag and drop functionality.
- Task cards change color based on their due date and status.

- The `saveTasksToLocalStorage` function saves the tasks to local storage.
- The `createTaskCard` function creates a new task card.
- The `printTaskData` function prints all the tasks.

- The `handleDrop` function handles the dropping of a task card into a new column.

## Future Plans
